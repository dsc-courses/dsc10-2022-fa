    "Welcome to the Final Project!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadlines 📅**: This assignment has two deadlines. \n",
    "- The first deadline is **Thursday, November 17th at 11:59PM**. This is a **checkpoint** by which you must submit Sections 0 and 1 of the project. You may not use slip days to extend this deadline. \n",
    "- The second deadline is **Tuesday, November 29th at 11:59PM**, and this is for your completed project submission. You may use up to two slip days to extend this deadline.  If working with a partner and using slip days, slip days will be deducted from each person’s allocation individually. If one or both partners has run out of slip days and you submit the project late, we will reallocate slip days towards the final project, away from lesser-weighted assignments, [as described in the syllabus](https://dsc10.com/syllabus/#deadlines-and-slip-days). \n",
    "\n",
    "10% of your grade will come from your score on the checkpoint, and 90% of your grade will come from your score on the final submission. See the EdStem post titled \"Final Project Released!\" for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partners 👯**: You are very much encouraged to find a partner to work through the project with. If you work with a partner, you are both required to actively contribute to **all parts** of the project. Updated [partner guidelines](https://dsc10.com/pair-programming/) are available on the course website. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules 📜**: Don't share your code with anybody but your partner. You are welcome to discuss questions with other students, but don't share the answers. The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for the final exam and your future in data science. If someone asks you for the answer, resist! Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support 🤝**: You are not alone! Come to office hours, post on EdStem, and talk to your classmates. If you want to ask about the details of your solution to a problem, make a private EdStem post and course staff will try to respond. All of the concepts necessary for this project were covered in lecture and can be found in the [textbook](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/intro.html) and [`babypandas` notes](https://notes.dsc10.com). If you are stuck on a particular problem, reading through the relevant textbook section or referencing the Jupyter notebook from lecture will often help clarify the concept. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Tests 🧪**: The `otter` tests don't usually tell you that your answer is correct. More often, they help catch basic mistakes. It's up to you to ensure that your answer is correct. Additional tests will be applied to verify the correctness of your submission in order to assign your final score, so be careful and check your work!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice 🦉**: First, **start early**. As you may know from the Midterm Project, projects are complex and time-consuming. Second, develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated task, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells, and you can add additional cells as needed. Don't try to do everything in one cell without seeing the intermediate output. In particular, for simulations where you need to do something many times, first just do the process once and make sure the results look reasonable. Then wrap your code inside a `for`-loop to repeat it. Similarly, for defining functions, first write code that will produce the desired output for a single fixed input. Then, once you know it's working, you can put that code inside a function and change the input to be a variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Seeds 🌱**: This project uses random seeds, as described in [Homework 6](http://datahub.ucsd.edu/user-redirect/git-sync?repo=https://github.com/dsc-courses/dsc10-2022-fa&subPath=homeworks/hw06/hw06.ipynb). When we provide a random seed, we set the internal configurations of Python's random number generator so that it produces the same results every time, making it easier to grade your submission. You don't need to understand how random seeds work, just be aware that when you see a call to `np.random.seed`:\n",
    "- Don't change it.\n",
    "- Don't be alarmed if you see the same results each time you run that cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Long Simulations ⏳**: If any of your cells are taking more than five minutes to run, you are probably doing something wrong. You can sometimes speed things up by making sure you have a DataFrame of *only* the rows and columns you need to do your analysis, which should be defined outside the for loop of your simulation. When possible, try to avoid using additional `for`-loops and queries inside a simulation, and see if a faster method, like a `numpy` method or `groupby`, could be used instead. If you haven't yet watched the video we provided on when **not** to use `for`-loops, it should be well worth your time."

    "Below, complete the implementation of the function `permutation_test`. It should do all three steps above, but for any two groups. `permutation_test` takes in the same 5 arguments as `diff_of_means`, which you defined in Question 2.3. (It contains an additional optional argument, `for_autograder`; you should ignore this.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that we've defined the difference in group means to be `group_1`'s mean minus `group_2`'s mean. So, if the observed difference in means is positive, this suggests that the mean of `group_1` may be *larger* than the mean of `group_2`. In that case, we'll formulate our null and alternative hypotheses like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "This is the setup we used in Section 2 when comparing DC characters (`group_1`) to Marvel characters (`group_2`), because the observed difference in means was positive.\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Null Hypothesis**: `group_1`'s data and `group_2`'s data come from the same distribution.\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis**: `group_1` has smaller data values than `group_2`, on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "How you set up the null and alternative hypotheses has implications for how you calculate the p-value since the p-value represents the proportion of simulations in which the simulated difference in means was equal to the observed difference in means or more extreme *in the direction of the alternative hypothesis*. \n",

    "**Question 6.3.** ⭐⭐⭐ Now, implement the bootstrap procedure to create an array called `boot_proportions` containing 10,000 estimates for the proportion of nonbinary Marvel characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using `.sample` with `replace=True` like you'd normally do for bootstrapping, here's a clever strategy that allows you to calculate resample proportions without the `.sample` method, which can be slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the `'NONBINARY'` column contains only 0s and 1s and bootstrapping requires us to sample with replacement, this means each element of our resample has a certain probability of being a 0 and some other probability of being a 1. These probabilities should add up to one. You can think of resampling from a sample of 0s and 1s as a lot like flipping a biased coin. You can find the proportion of 1s in your resample in much the same way you might find the proportion of heads in many coin flips, using `np.random.multinomial`. (It's also possible to do this with `np.random.choice`, but please use `np.random.multinomial` here.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This alternate strategy adds up to a huge time savings. With `.sample`, it takes about 1 minute to do 100 repetitions of the bootstrap on a DataFrame of this size, which means to do 10,000 repetitions, it would take about 100 minutes (over an hour 🥱). With `np.random.multinomial`, you should be able to do 10,000 repetitions of the bootstrap in only a few seconds!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do not use `.sample` or `np.random.choice` for this question. Instead, you must use `np.random.multinomial`; think carefully about the probability distribution you will provide as its second argument.**\n",
