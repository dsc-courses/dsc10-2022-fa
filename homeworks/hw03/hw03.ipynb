It's up to you to ensure that your answer is correct. If you're not sure, ask someone (not for the answer, but for some guidance about your approach). These are great questions for office hours (see the schedule on the [Calendar](https://dsc10.com/calendar)) or EdStem. Directly sharing answers is not okay, but discussing problems with the course staff or with other students is encouraged. \n",

But if you do know what they are and are wondering why it's not OK to use them, it is because loops in Python are slow, and looping over arrays and DataFrames should usually be avoided."
