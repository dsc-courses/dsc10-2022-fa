A couple of months ago the city resurfaced Laurel Street between 5th and Front and re-striped the road to add a bike lane.  Since then, no other work has been done to complete the project to finish the resurfing and restriping of rest of West Laurel heading towards I-5 and the airport.  Because the restriping and resurfacing stops at Front Street, there is a significant shift in the traffic pattern coming up the hill on West Laurel at Front Street where the new resurfaced road is and the lane shifts to the left.  This shift leads drivers into the back of cars parked along the south side of West Laurel.  I would like to know when the city plans on finishing this project.  Thank you for your time."
