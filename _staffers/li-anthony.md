Hi! I'm Anthony and I'm currently a third-year Data Science major. I'm thrilled to be tutoring DSC 1O this quarter and am excited to meet you all and to help you guys out to the best of my ability. Aside from school, I love to do art and photography and I'm still looking to pick up some new hobbies that excite me!
