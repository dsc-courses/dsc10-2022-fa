Hi, I am Yutian Shi (Skylar). I am a rising junior majoring in Data Science and minoring in Photography from China. This is my first time tutoring, and I feel so excited since DSC10 is the course that motivated me into this major! Fun facts about me: I came here even without knowing how to make a fried egg, while gradually learning to cook within a few months :)
