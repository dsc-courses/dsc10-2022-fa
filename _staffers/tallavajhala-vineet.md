Hi everyone, my name is Vineet and I am ecstatic about tutoring for DSC 10 this year and meeting everyone. I'm a double major in Data Science and Business economics and most likely going to pursue a career in software engineering after graduation. In my free time, I love playing basketball, gaming, and watching my favorite sports teams (Kansas City Chiefs and KU basketball).
