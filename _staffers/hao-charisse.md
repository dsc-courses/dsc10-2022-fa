Hello! My name is Charisse Hao and I am a 2nd year Data Science Major from the Bay Area. This is my first time tutoring for DSC 10 and I'm excited to help you all as you begin to explore the field of data science. Outside of school, I enjoy listening to music, watching kdramas, and playing video games with friends. Feel free to visit my office hours, as I'm looking forward to meeting everyone!
