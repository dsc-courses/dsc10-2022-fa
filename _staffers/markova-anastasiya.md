Hi! I am a sophomore at UCSD majoring in Cognitive Science with a Specialization in Machine Learning and minoring in Data Science. I am originally from Lviv, Ukraine, but I moved to the U.S. 7 years ago and now live in Dallas, so both places feel like home to me now. I am excited to tutor DSC 10, because I hope to help everyone (DSC major or not) have fun in this class just like I did. When not studying, I love to drink a lot of tea, go to museums, and recently I also fell in love with ceramics (and now I can't stop staring at mugs and bowls).
