Hello, my name is Daphne! I'm a third year Data Science major pursuing a career within the intersection of AI/ML and the medicine field, but I also take interest in front-end webdev. Outside of my academic life, I captain a dance team, work at a non-profit data science organization and love burning time looking for new music on Spotify. I look forward to hearing about your guys' aspirations and seeing them come to fruition as you learn about the fundamentals of data science throughout the quarter in DSC 10; see you in office hours!
