Hi everyone! I'm Tony and I'm a 4th year Data Science major from San Jose, California. In my spare time, I enjoy watching soccer and football, exploring San Diego with my friends, building Legos, and eating food. DSC 10 is one of my favorite classes because of the variety of topics that are covered. It's a great introductory class to the field of data science and I look forward to meeting you all!
