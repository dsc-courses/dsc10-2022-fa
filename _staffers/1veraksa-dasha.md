Hi! My name is Dasha and I am a Bioengineering Masters student, focusing on bioinformatics. I completed my Bachelors in Biomedical Engineering at Boston University. I was actually born in San Diego but moved to Boston when I was 3 months old, so returning feels like coming home. I am hoping to finally learn how to surf! This is my first time TAing for DSC 10, so I am just as excited as you to start the quarter. I love exploring datasets because there are so many ways to visualize and learn from data, and I hope to spark that interest in you as well.
