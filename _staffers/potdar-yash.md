Hey everyone! My name is Yash, and I’m a fourth-year majoring in Data Science and Cognitive Science originally from the Bay Area. This is my sixth quarter as a Tutor (fifth time for DSC 10!), and I'm truly excited to mentor and work with you all! In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis, paddleboarding, cooking, and following sports (go Warriors and Niners!). I look forward to meeting you this quarter!
