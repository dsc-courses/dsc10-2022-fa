Hello everyone! My name is Eric and I’m a second-year Data Science major from Orange County. When I’m not focused on school, I really like watching food-related videos and listening to K-Pop (been listening to a lot of Seventeen). This is my third time tutoring DSC 10, but my first time teaching the new cohort of entering Data Science majors. I can't wait to meet you all and I hope we will be able to learn a lot from each other!
