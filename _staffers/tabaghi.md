Hi! My name is Puoya and I am going to teach DSC 10 this quarter, for the first time. I joined UCSD as a postdoc earlier this year. Prior to this, I completed Electrical and Computer Engineering degrees in Illinois, Colorado, and Tehran â€”where I grew up. Aside from teaching and research, I fill my time with going to the gym, practicing yoga, or watching awesome international movies.

DSC 10 is a great course because it empowers you to uncover insights hidden in data and learn from them which is important in pursuing many fields of science and technology, especially Data Science.
