Welcome to DSC 10! 👋 I'm in my second year as a lecturer in Data Science at UCSD. Prior to moving to San Diego, I was a student at UC Berkeley, where I also taught Data Science. And before that, I grew up in Windsor, Ontario – make sure to tell me if you’re also Canadian! 🇨🇦 Outside of the classroom, you’ll find me learning how to cook, FaceTiming my dog 🐶 back home, watching basketball, or somehow being [randomly selected to win gift cards on morning talk shows](http://rampure.org/assets/me_dancing.gif).

DSC 10 is such an important course, whether or not you decide to pursue Data Science further. We really hope you enjoy it! 😊
