Hello, and welcome to DSC 10! My name is Dylan, and I'm a fourth-year Data Science major with minors in Cognitive Science and Mathematics from Fountain Valley, CA! I truly believe that DSC 10 is an exciting and rewarding course for how it teaches us to uncover meaningful insights from datasets filled with seemingly random numbers and text. I'm also one of the HDSI Student Representatives, so please feel free to reach out if you have any questions regarding the class or the Data Science major in general!
