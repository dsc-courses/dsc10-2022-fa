Hi everyone! I’m Diego and I’m a third year Data Science major. In my free time I like playing basketball, cooking, and going out to make memories with friends. I’m looking forward to tutoring DSC 10 this quarter because it’s the class that got me excited about a career in data science. I’ve received so much support from the staff so I’m excited to pass on the favor and work with you all!
