Hi! My name is Tiffany and I am a second-year Data Science student from Warren College. Besides studying, I love dancing and playing the piano. This is my third time tutoring DSC 10 and I am super excited to pass on my passion to all of you. Feel free to chat with me about anything related to data science! :)
