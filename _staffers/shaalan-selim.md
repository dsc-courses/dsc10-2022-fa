Hey everyone, my name is Selim and i'm very excited to tutor DSC10 this quarter. I was born and raised in Cairo,Egypt and im still exploring San Diego so feel free to share your favorite hangout spots with me. I'm a 4th year Math-Econ major and a Data science minor and i love tutoring DSC10 because its the class that made me decide to add my minor and hopefully continue in a Data Science field. I'm currently trying (and failing) to teach myself guitar so I can play 2006 Arctic Monkeys songs.
